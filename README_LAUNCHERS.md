# 🚀 Trading System Launchers

## Problem Solved ✅

You were getting the error:
```
can't open file '/Users/gogineni/Python/enhanced_trading_system_complete.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

**Reason**: The trading system files are in `/Users/gogineni/Python/myenv/trading-system/` but you were trying to run from `/Users/gogineni/Python/`

## Solution: Use the Launchers 🎯

I've created launcher scripts in your current directory that automatically run everything from the correct location.
