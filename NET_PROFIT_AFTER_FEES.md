# Net Profit Calculation After Transaction Fees

## Overview

Modified the quick profit-taking logic to calculate **NET profit after ALL transaction fees** (both entry and exit), ensuring the system only exits when you actually receive ₹5-10k in your pocket.

**Version**: 2.8.0
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**User Request**: "calculate the transaction charges (entry and exit fee). with all the calculations of fees the profit should be between 5k-10k"

## Problem

**Before**: System checked **gross P&L** without considering transaction fees
- Position showing ₹15,082 gross profit
- But transaction fees could reduce actual profit significantly
- User might not actually get ₹10k after all fees

**After**: System checks **NET profit** after deducting all transaction fees
- Calculates exit fees before deciding to exit
- Only exits when NET profit (what you actually get) is ₹5-10k
- Ensures you receive the full amount after fees

## Transaction Fee Structure

### Entry Fees (Already Deducted)
When position is opened, `invested_amount` includes:
- **Brokerage**: 0.02% (max ₹20)
- **Transaction charges**: 0.00325%
- **GST**: 18% on (brokerage + transaction charges)

### Exit Fees (Now Calculated Before Exit)
When position is closed, additional fees:
- **Brokerage**: 0.02% (max ₹20)
- **Transaction charges**: 0.00325%
- **GST**: 18% on (brokerage + transaction charges)
- **STT (Securities Transaction Tax)**: 0.1% on sell value

### Total Fee Calculation

```python
# Entry fees (buy)
brokerage = min(entry_value × 0.0002, 20.0)
trans_charges = entry_value × 0.0000325
gst = (brokerage + trans_charges) × 0.18
entry_fees = brokerage + trans_charges + gst

# Exit fees (sell) - includes STT
brokerage = min(exit_value × 0.0002, 20.0)
trans_charges = exit_value × 0.0000325
gst = (brokerage + trans_charges) × 0.18
stt = exit_value × 0.001  # 0.1%
exit_fees = brokerage + trans_charges + gst + stt

# Total fees
total_fees = entry_fees + exit_fees
```

## Implementation

### Modified Code

**Location**: [enhanced_trading_system_complete.py:1895-1914](enhanced_trading_system_complete.py#L1895-L1914)

```python
# Profit/Loss based exits
# ENHANCEMENT: Quick profit taking at ₹5-10k levels (user request)
# CRITICAL: Calculate NET profit after deducting exit transaction fees
# This ensures we only exit when actual profit after all fees is ₹5-10k

# Calculate exit fees (estimate based on exit value)
exit_value = current_price * abs(shares_held)
estimated_exit_fees = self.calculate_transaction_costs(exit_value, "sell")

# NET profit = Gross P&L - Exit fees
# (entry fees already deducted in unrealized_pnl via invested_amount)
net_profit = unrealized_pnl - estimated_exit_fees

if net_profit >= 5000:  # ₹5,000 NET profit after ALL fees
    should_exit = True
    if net_profit >= 10000:
        exit_reason = f"Quick profit taking (Net: ₹{net_profit:,.0f} > ₹10k after fees)"
        logger.logger.info(f"🎯 {symbol}: Quick profit trigger - Gross: ₹{unrealized_pnl:,.0f}, Exit fees: ₹{estimated_exit_fees:,.0f}, NET: ₹{net_profit:,.0f} > ₹10k")
    else:
        exit_reason = f"Quick profit taking (Net: ₹{net_profit:,.0f} > ₹5k after fees)"
        logger.logger.info(f"🎯 {symbol}: Quick profit trigger - Gross: ₹{unrealized_pnl:,.0f}, Exit fees: ₹{estimated_exit_fees:,.0f}, NET: ₹{net_profit:,.0f} > ₹5k")
```

### Key Changes

1. **Calculate exit fees BEFORE checking profit**:
   ```python
   exit_value = current_price * abs(shares_held)
   estimated_exit_fees = self.calculate_transaction_costs(exit_value, "sell")
   ```

2. **Deduct exit fees from gross P&L**:
   ```python
   net_profit = unrealized_pnl - estimated_exit_fees
   ```

3. **Check NET profit, not gross**:
   ```python
   if net_profit >= 5000:  # Was: unrealized_pnl >= 5000
   ```

4. **Show breakdown in logs**:
   ```python
   logger.info(f"Gross: ₹{unrealized_pnl:,.0f}, Exit fees: ₹{estimated_exit_fees:,.0f}, NET: ₹{net_profit:,.0f}")
   ```

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Your NIFTY Position

**Position Details**:
- Symbol: NIFTY25O0725350PE
- Shares: 680
- Entry Price: ₹523.54
- Current Price: ₹545.72

**Calculations**:
```
Entry value = 680 × ₹523.54 = ₹356,007.20
Exit value = 680 × ₹545.72 = ₹371,089.60
Gross P&L = (₹545.72 - ₹523.54) × 680 = ₹15,082.40
```

**Exit Fees**:
```
Brokerage = min(₹371,089.60 × 0.0002, ₹20) = ₹20.00
Trans charges = ₹371,089.60 × 0.0000325 = ₹12.06
GST = (₹20.00 + ₹12.06) × 0.18 = ₹5.77
STT = ₹371,089.60 × 0.001 = ₹371.09
Total exit fees = ₹408.92
```

**NET Profit**:
```
NET Profit = ₹15,082.40 - ₹408.92 = ₹14,673.48
```

**Decision**: ✅ **WILL EXIT** (₹14,673 > ₹10k)

**Log Output**:
```
🎯 NIFTY25O0725350PE: Quick profit trigger - Gross: ₹15,082, Exit fees: ₹409, NET: ₹14,673 > ₹10k
💼 Attempting exit for NIFTY25O0725350PE: Quick profit taking (Net: ₹14,673 > ₹10k after fees)
```

### Example 2: Position Near ₹10k Threshold

**Position Details**:
- Shares: 500
- Entry: ₹100.00
- Current: ₹120.80

**Calculations**:
```
Gross P&L = (₹120.80 - ₹100.00) × 500 = ₹10,400.00
Exit value = 500 × ₹120.80 = ₹60,400.00
Exit fees = ₹76.97
NET Profit = ₹10,400.00 - ₹76.97 = ₹10,323.03
```

**Decision**: ✅ **WILL EXIT** (₹10,323 > ₹10k)

### Example 3: Gross Profit ₹5.5k but NET < ₹5k

**Position Details**:
- Shares: 300
- Entry: ₹200.00
- Current: ₹218.50

**Calculations**:
```
Gross P&L = (₹218.50 - ₹200.00) × 300 = ₹5,550.00
Exit value = 300 × ₹218.50 = ₹65,550.00
Exit fees = ₹83.53
NET Profit = ₹5,550.00 - ₹83.53 = ₹5,466.47
```

**Decision**: ✅ **WILL EXIT** (₹5,466 > ₹5k)

### Example 4: Position That Won't Exit (Before vs After)

**Position Details**:
- Shares: 200
- Entry: ₹150.00
- Current: ₹175.50

**Calculations**:
```
Gross P&L = (₹175.50 - ₹150.00) × 200 = ₹5,100.00
Exit value = 200 × ₹175.50 = ₹35,100.00
Exit fees = ₹50.25
NET Profit = ₹5,100.00 - ₹50.25 = ₹5,049.75
```

**Before Fix**: Would exit (gross ₹5,100 > ₹5k)
**After Fix**: ✅ **WILL EXIT** (net ₹5,049 > ₹5k)

## Impact on Your Positions

## Fee Impact Analysis

For different trade sizes:

| Exit Value | Exit Fees | Fee % | Impact on ₹10k Gross |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| ₹50,000 | ~₹71 | 0.14% | NET = ₹9,929 ❌ |
| ₹100,000 | ~₹130 | 0.13% | NET = ₹9,870 ❌ |
| ₹200,000 | ~₹245 | 0.12% | NET = ₹9,755 ❌ |
| ₹370,000 | ~₹409 | 0.11% | NET = ₹9,591 ❌ |
| ₹500,000 | ~₹543 | 0.11% | NET = ₹9,457 ❌ |

**Key Insight**: For ₹10k gross profit to become ₹10k NET, you need slightly higher gross profit depending on position size.

## Summary

**Change**: Quick profit logic now uses NET profit (after ALL fees) instead of gross P&L

**Formula**:
```
NET Profit = Gross P&L - Exit Fees
           = (Current Price - Entry Price) × Shares - Exit Fees
```

**Thresholds**:
- ₹5,000 NET profit → Exit
- ₹10,000 NET profit → Exit

**Your Positions**: Both NIFTY and BANKEX will still exit (NET > ₹10k) ✅

**Benefit**: Ensures you actually receive ₹5-10k in your account, not just on paper!
