## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Unable to connect" or "Connection refused"

**Symptoms**:
- Browser shows "Unable to connect"
- "Connection refused" error
- Page doesn't load

**Solution 1: Check if dashboard is running**
```bash
ps aux | grep dashboard
```

If no process is running, start it:
```bash
python enhanced_dashboard_server.py &
```

**Solution 2: Check port 8080**
```bash
lsof -i :8080
```

If something else is using port 8080, kill it:
```bash
kill -9 <PID>
python enhanced_dashboard_server.py &
```

### Issue 2: Dashboard Starts but Shows No Data

**Symptoms**:
- Dashboard loads but shows:
  - "No signals detected"
  - "No active positions"
  - "Waiting for data..."

**Cause**: Trading system is not running or not connected

**Solution**:

1. **Start the trading system** with F&O mode:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_trading_system_complete.py
   # Select option 2 (F&O Trading)
   # Select paper/live trading mode
   ```

2. **Check dashboard connection in logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/trading_*.log | grep -i dashboard
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Dashboard: Connected to http://localhost:8080
   üìä Sending signal to dashboard...
   üìä Sending position update to dashboard...
   ```

3. **If you see "Dashboard: Not connected"**:
   - The trading system couldn't reach the dashboard
   - Make sure dashboard is running first
   - Then start the trading system

---

### Issue 3: Dashboard Shows Old Data

**Symptoms**:
- Dashboard shows positions from previous sessions
- Trades not updating in real-time
- Time shows old timestamps

**Solution**:

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Clear cache

3. **Restart dashboard**:
   ```bash
   # Kill current dashboard
   pkill -f enhanced_dashboard_server.py

   # Start fresh
   python enhanced_dashboard_server.py &
   ```

---

### Issue 4: Dashboard Running but Trading System Can't Connect

**Symptoms**:
- Logs show: "‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard: Not connected"
- Dashboard loads in browser but no data from trading system

**Cause**: Trading system started before dashboard

**Solution**:

**Always start in this order:**
1. **First**: Start dashboard
   ```bash
   python enhanced_dashboard_server.py &
   sleep 3  # Wait for it to start
   ```

2. **Then**: Start trading system
   ```bash
   python enhanced_trading_system_complete.py
   ```

**Or use the all-in-one approach:**
```bash
python enhanced_trading_system_complete.py
# It will auto-start the dashboard
```

---

### Issue 5: Port 8080 Already in Use

**Symptoms**:
- Error: "Address already in use"
- Dashboard won't start

**Solution 1: Find and kill the process**
```bash
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
python enhanced_dashboard_server.py &
```

**Solution 2: Change dashboard port**

Edit `enhanced_dashboard_server.py`:
```python
# Line ~1300, change:
PORT = 8080

# To:
PORT = 8081  # Or any other available port
```

Then access at: http://localhost:8081

---

### Issue 6: Trade History Not Showing

**Symptoms**:
- Trade History tab shows "No completed trades yet"
- But trades have been executed

**Cause**: This was a previous bug (already fixed)

**Solution**:

1. **Check logs for trade completions**:
   ```bash
   grep "completed trade to dashboard" logs/trading_*.log
   ```

2. **Verify fix is in place** (Line 4195):
   ```python
   # Should have 'trade_history' in return:
   return {
       'signals': signals,
       'trades': trades,
       'positions': positions,
       'portfolio': portfolio,
       'performance': performance,
       'system_status': system_status,
       'trade_history': trade_history  # ‚úÖ Should be here
   }
   ```

3. **Restart both dashboard and trading system**

Expected: HTML output starting with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
