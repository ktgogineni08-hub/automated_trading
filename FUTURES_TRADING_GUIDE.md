## Candlestick Patterns

### Understanding Candlesticks

A candlestick shows four key prices:
- **Open**: Price at the start of the time period
- **Close**: Price at the end of the time period
- **High**: Highest price during the period
- **Low**: Lowest price during the period

**Body**: Area between open and close
**Wicks/Shadows**: Lines extending above and below the body

Candle 2: • (Small body, gap down)
Candle 3: ▲ (Large green, closes above midpoint of candle 1)
```

#### 3. **Bullish Engulfing** ⭐
- **Appearance**: Small red candle followed by larger green candle that completely engulfs it

- **Signal**: Potential reversal DOWN - **SELL signal**

**Example**:
```
     |  ← Small body at top
     |
     |  ← Long lower wick
     |
```

#### 2. **Evening Star** ⭐⭐

## Entry and Exit Strategies

### Entry Rules

#### For LONG (BUY) Entry
1. **Trend Confirmation**: Price above 20 EMA and 50 EMA
2. **Candlestick Signal**: Bullish pattern (Hammer, Morning Star, Bullish Engulfing)
3. **Support Level**: Price bounces from support
4. **Volume**: Above-average volume on bullish candle
5. **Confirmation**: Next candle closes above pattern high

**Entry Trigger**: When ALL conditions met

#### For SHORT (SELL) Entry
1. **Trend Confirmation**: Price below 20 EMA and 50 EMA
2. **Candlestick Signal**: Bearish pattern (Hanging Man, Evening Star)
3. **Resistance Level**: Price rejects at resistance
4. **Volume**: Above-average volume on bearish candle
5. **Confirmation**: Next candle closes below pattern low

### Exit Strategies

#### Exit for Profit (Take Profit)

**Method 1: Fixed Risk-Reward Ratio**
- Minimum 1:2 risk-reward
- Example: Stop loss ₹100 → Target ₹200

**Method 2: Technical Levels**
- Exit at next resistance (for longs)
- Exit at next support (for shorts)

**Method 3: Trailing Stop**
- Move stop loss as price moves in your favor
- Trail by ATR (Average True Range)
- For NIFTY futures: Trail by 50-75 points

**Method 4: Time-Based**
- Intraday: Exit before 3:15 PM (avoid last 15 min volatility)
- Swing: Hold 2-5 days max for futures

**Method 5: Candlestick Reversal**
- Exit when opposite pattern appears
- Example: Long position + Evening Star appears = EXIT

#### Exit for Loss (Stop Loss)

**Never trade without a stop loss!**

**Method 1: Technical Stop**
- Long: Below recent swing low or support
- Short: Above recent swing high or resistance

**Method 2: ATR-Based Stop**
- NIFTY: 1.5x ATR (typically 80-120 points)
- Bank NIFTY: 2x ATR (typically 150-250 points)

**Method 3: Percentage Stop**
- Risk 1-2% of capital per trade
- Example: ₹100,000 capital → Max loss ₹1,000-2,000

**Method 4: Time-Based Stop**
- If trade not profitable within 1 hour (intraday) → Exit
- Prevents holding losing positions

### Entry Timing

**Best Times for NIFTY Futures**:
- **9:15 - 9:30 AM**: Market open - high volatility, good for momentum trades
- **10:00 - 11:00 AM**: Post-opening stabilization - clearer trends
- **2:00 - 3:00 PM**: Good liquidity, avoid 3:15-3:30 PM (high risk)

**Avoid**:
- First 5 minutes (9:15-9:20) - very volatile
- Last 15 minutes (3:15-3:30) - expiry pressure, erratic moves

## Profit Targets and Stop Loss

### Calculating Profit Targets

#### Method 1: Risk-Reward Based

**Formula**:
```
Entry Price: 24,500
Stop Loss: 24,400 (100 points below)
Risk: 100 points
Reward (2:1): 200 points
Target: 24,500 + 200 = 24,700
```

**For Your System**:
```python
risk = entry_price - stop_loss
reward = risk * 2  # 2:1 ratio
target = entry_price + reward
```

#### Method 2: ATR-Based

**Formula**:
```
ATR for NIFTY = 80 points (example)
Stop Loss: Entry - (1.5 × ATR) = Entry - 120
Target: Entry + (3 × ATR) = Entry + 240
```

This gives a 2:1 risk-reward automatically.

#### Method 3: Support/Resistance Based

**For LONGS**:
```
Entry: 24,500 (at support)
Stop: 24,400 (below support)
Target 1: 24,700 (next resistance)
Target 2: 24,900 (major resistance)
```

**Strategy**: Exit 50% at Target 1, move stop to breakeven, hold 50% for Target 2

#### Method 4: Fibonacci Extensions

After a move from support to resistance:
- **Target 1**: 1.272 extension
- **Target 2**: 1.618 extension
- **Target 3**: 2.0 extension

### Stop Loss Strategies

#### 1. **Fixed Point Stop**
- NIFTY: 50-100 points
- Bank NIFTY: 150-250 points
- Simple but doesn't adapt to volatility

#### 2. **ATR Stop Loss** ⭐ Recommended
```python
# For your system
atr = calculate_atr(14_periods)  # 14-period ATR
stop_loss_distance = atr * 1.5

if going_long:
    stop_loss = entry_price - stop_loss_distance
else:  # going_short
    stop_loss = entry_price + stop_loss_distance
```

**Why ATR?**
- Adapts to current volatility
- Wider stops in volatile markets (prevents premature stops)
- Tighter stops in calm markets (better risk management)

#### 3. **Swing High/Low Stop**
- Long: Below recent swing low
- Short: Above recent swing high
- Most logical - respects price structure

#### 4. **Trailing Stop** ⭐ For Profit Protection

**Method A: Fixed Trail**
```python
# Trail by 50 points for NIFTY
if profit > initial_risk:
    # Move stop to breakeven first
    stop_loss = entry_price

    # Then trail as profit increases
    for every 50 points profit:
        move stop_loss up by 30 points
```

**Method B: ATR Trail**
```python
# Update stop on each candle close
if going_long:
    new_stop = current_high - (atr * 2)
    stop_loss = max(stop_loss, new_stop)  # Only move up, never down
```

### Position Sizing Based on Stop Loss

**Formula**:
```
Risk per trade = Account size × Risk % (1-2%)
Position size = Risk per trade / Stop loss distance

Example:
Account: ₹500,000
Risk %: 1% = ₹5,000
Entry: 24,500
Stop: 24,400
Stop distance: 100 points

NIFTY lot size: 50
Per point value: 50
Stop loss value: 100 points × 50 = ₹5,000 per lot

Position size: ₹5,000 / ₹5,000 = 1 lot
```

**For Your System (₹5-10k Profit Target)**:
```python
def calculate_position_size(capital, entry, stop_loss, risk_percent=1):
    """
    Calculate position size for futures trading

    capital: Total trading capital
    entry: Entry price
    stop_loss: Stop loss price
    risk_percent: % of capital to risk (1-2%)
    """
    risk_amount = capital * (risk_percent / 100)
    stop_distance = abs(entry - stop_loss)

    # NIFTY 50 future
    lot_size = 50
    point_value = 50

    # Risk per lot
    risk_per_lot = stop_distance * point_value

    # Number of lots
    lots = int(risk_amount / risk_per_lot)

    return max(1, lots)  # Minimum 1 lot
```

## Support and Resistance Levels

### What Are Support and Resistance?

**Support**: Price level where buying pressure is strong enough to prevent price from falling further
**Resistance**: Price level where selling pressure is strong enough to prevent price from rising further

### How to Identify Support/Resistance

#### 1. **Horizontal Levels** (Most Reliable)

Look for prices where:
- Price bounced multiple times
- Price stalled or consolidated
- High volume occurred

**Example for NIFTY**:
```
Resistance: 25,000 (psychological level, tested 3 times)
Support: 24,500 (bounced twice in last week)
Current: 24,750

Strategy:
- Buy near 24,500 support, stop at 24,400, target 24,950
- Sell near 25,000 resistance, stop at 25,100, target 24,600
```

#### 2. **Moving Averages as Dynamic Support/Resistance**

**Key MAs**:
- 20 EMA: Short-term trend
- 50 EMA: Medium-term trend
- 200 EMA: Long-term trend

**Usage**:
- In uptrend: 20 EMA acts as support
- In downtrend: 20 EMA acts as resistance

#### 3. **Pivot Points** (For Intraday)

**Formula**:
```
Pivot (P) = (Previous High + Previous Low + Previous Close) / 3

Resistance 1 (R1) = (2 × P) - Previous Low
Resistance 2 (R2) = P + (Previous High - Previous Low)
Resistance 3 (R3) = Previous High + 2(P - Previous Low)

Support 1 (S1) = (2 × P) - Previous High
Support 2 (S2) = P - (Previous High - Previous Low)
Support 3 (S3) = Previous Low - 2(Previous High - P)
```

**How to Use**:
- Price above pivot → Bullish bias
- Price below pivot → Bearish bias
- S1, S2, S3 = Support levels
- R1, R2, R3 = Resistance levels

#### 4. **Fibonacci Retracement** (For Swing Trading)

After a strong move, price often retraces to:
- **23.6%**: Shallow retracement (strong trend)
- **38.2%**: Moderate retracement
- **50.0%**: Common retracement level
- **61.8%**: Deep retracement (golden ratio)
- **78.6%**: Very deep (trend may be weakening)

**Usage**:
```
NIFTY moved from 24,000 to 25,000 (1000 point move)

Retracement levels:
76.4% (23.6% retrace): 24,764
61.8% (38.2% retrace): 24,618
50.0% (50% retrace): 24,500  ← Strong support
38.2% (61.8% retrace): 24,382
```

**Strategy**: Buy at 50% or 61.8% retracement in uptrend

## Position Sizing and Risk Management

### The 1% Rule ⭐ Most Important

**Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a single trade**

```python
Account: ₹500,000
Risk per trade: 1% = ₹5,000

Trade Setup:
Entry: 24,500
Stop: 24,400 (100 points)

NIFTY lot size: 50
Point value: ₹50 per point
Loss per lot: 100 points × ₹50 = ₹5,000

Position size: ₹5,000 / ₹5,000 = 1 lot ✅

If stop was 200 points:
Loss per lot: 200 × ₹50 = ₹10,000
Position size: ₹5,000 / ₹10,000 = 0.5 lots
→ Can only take 1 lot, risk is 2% ⚠️
```

### Position Sizing Formula

```python
def calculate_position_size(account_size, risk_percent, entry, stop_loss):
    """
    Calculate position size for futures

    account_size: Total trading capital (₹)
    risk_percent: % to risk (1-2%)
    entry: Entry price
    stop_loss: Stop loss price

    Returns: Number of lots to trade
    """
    # Maximum risk amount
    max_risk = account_size * (risk_percent / 100)

    # Stop distance in points
    stop_distance = abs(entry - stop_loss)

    # For NIFTY 50
    lot_size = 50
    point_value = 50

    # Risk per lot
    risk_per_lot = stop_distance * point_value

    # Calculate lots
    lots = max_risk / risk_per_lot

    # Round down to whole lots
    return int(lots) if lots >= 1 else 0

# Example usage
lots = calculate_position_size(
    account_size=500000,  # ₹5 lakh
    risk_percent=1,       # 1% risk
    entry=24500,
    stop_loss=24400       # 100 point stop
)
print(f"Trade {lots} lot(s)")  # Output: 1 lot
```

### Leverage Management

**Futures have built-in leverage!**

```
NIFTY 50 Future at 24,500:
Contract value = 24,500 × 50 = ₹12,25,000
Margin required = ~₹1,50,000 (12-15%)
Leverage = 8-10x

This means:
- 1% move = 8-10% gain/loss on margin
- 100 point move = ₹5,000 profit/loss per lot
```

**Leverage Guidelines**:
- **Beginners**: Use 2-3x leverage (trade 2-3 lots per ₹5 lakh)
- **Intermediate**: Use 4-5x leverage
- **Advanced**: Max 8x leverage
- **Never**: Use full leverage (very high risk)

### Multiple Position Management

**Maximum Positions**: 3-5 open positions at once

**Correlation Risk**:
- Don't trade NIFTY + Bank NIFTY + FINNIFTY all together (highly correlated)
- Diversify: 1 equity index + 1 commodity + 1 currency

**Total Risk**: Never exceed 5% of capital at risk across all positions

```
Example:
Account: ₹500,000
Max total risk: 5% = ₹25,000

Position 1 (NIFTY): ₹5,000 risk
Position 2 (Bank NIFTY): ₹5,000 risk
Position 3 (USDINR): ₹5,000 risk
Total risk: ₹15,000 (3%) ✅
```

### Drawdown Management

**Maximum Drawdown**: Stop trading if you lose 10% of capital

```
Starting capital: ₹500,000
10% drawdown: ₹50,000
Stop level: ₹450,000

If you reach ₹450,000:
1. Stop trading for 1 week
2. Review all trades
3. Identify mistakes
4. Paper trade for 2 weeks
5. Resume with smaller size
```

**Daily Loss Limit**: Stop for the day if you lose 3%

```
Daily loss limit: 3% × ₹500,000 = ₹15,000

If you lose ₹15,000 in a day:
- Close all positions
- Stop trading for the day
- Prevents emotional revenge trading
```

### Index Correlation and Portfolio Strategy

#### Correlation Between Indices

**High Correlation (95%+)** - Avoid trading together:
- NIFTY 50 ↔ SENSEX (almost identical, both large-cap)
- Bank NIFTY ↔ BANKEX (both banking indices)

**Medium Correlation (70-85%)** - Trade cautiously:
- NIFTY 50 ↔ Bank NIFTY
- NIFTY 50 ↔ FINNIFTY
- SENSEX ↔ BANKEX
- Bank NIFTY ↔ FINNIFTY

**Lower Correlation (50-70%)** - Better diversification:
- NIFTY 50 ↔ MIDCPNIFTY
- Bank NIFTY ↔ MIDCPNIFTY
- SENSEX ↔ MIDCPNIFTY

#### Recommended Portfolio Combinations

**Conservative Portfolio** (₹5 lakh capital):
```
Position 1: NIFTY 50 (1 lot) - Risk ₹5,000
Position 2: FINNIFTY (1 lot) - Risk ₹5,000
Total positions: 2
Total risk: ₹10,000 (2%)
```

**Moderate Portfolio** (₹5 lakh capital):
```
Position 1: NIFTY 50 (1 lot) - Risk ₹5,000
Position 2: Bank NIFTY (1 lot) - Risk ₹5,000
Position 3: MIDCPNIFTY (1 lot) - Risk ₹5,000
Total positions: 3
Total risk: ₹15,000 (3%)
```

Position 2: MIDCPNIFTY (1 lot) - Risk ₹8,000
Total positions: 3
Total risk: ₹18,000 (3.6%)
```

**⚠️ AVOID**:
- Trading NIFTY + SENSEX together (redundant, 95% correlation)
- Trading Bank NIFTY + BANKEX together (redundant)
- Having more than 3-4 positions at once (overtrading)
- Trading all 6 indices simultaneously (excessive correlation, over-leverage)

#### Which Index to Choose Based on Market Conditions

**Trending Bull Market**:
- Primary: NIFTY 50, SENSEX (stable trends)
- Secondary: MIDCPNIFTY (momentum plays)
- Avoid: Bank NIFTY (too choppy in strong trends)

**High Volatility/News-Driven Market**:
- Primary: Bank NIFTY, BANKEX (react strongly to RBI news)
- Secondary: FINNIFTY (financial sector news)
- Avoid: NIFTY 50 (slower to react)

**Range-Bound/Sideways Market**:
- Primary: NIFTY 50, SENSEX (clearer support/resistance)
- Secondary: FINNIFTY (moderate volatility)
- Avoid: MIDCPNIFTY (whipsaws in range)

**Your ₹5-10k Profit System - Best Indices**:
```
Best for quick ₹5-10k profits:
1. MIDCPNIFTY (75 point move = ₹5,625 per lot) ⭐
2. NIFTY 50 (100-200 point moves = ₹5,000-10,000) ⭐⭐
3. Bank NIFTY (300-600 point moves, but volatile)

Avoid for this strategy:
- SENSEX (only ₹10 per point, need 500-1000 point moves)
- Multiple positions simultaneously (harder to manage exits)
```

        entry = close
        stop_loss = close - (ATR * 1.5)
        target = close + (ATR * 3)

# Exit Rules
use_trailing_stop = True
trail_distance = ATR * 2
```

**Success Rate**: 50-55% but large winners compensate

#### Strategy 5: 5-10k Profit Target (For Your System)

**Optimized for ₹5,000-10,000 profit per trade**

```python
# Setup
account_size = 200000  # ₹2 lakh
profit_target_min = 5000
profit_target_max = 10000
lot_size = 50  # NIFTY

# Calculate point targets
points_for_5k = 5000 / 50 = 100 points
points_for_10k = 10000 / 50 = 200 points

# Entry Rules
1. Identify strong trend (price > 20 EMA > 50 EMA)
2. Wait for pullback to 20 EMA
3. Bullish candle pattern at EMA
4. Enter on break of candle high

# Position Sizing
entry = 24500
stop = 24400  # 100 points
risk_per_lot = 100 * 50 = ₹5000

lots_to_trade = 1  # Risk ₹5,000 per lot

# Profit Targets
target_1 = entry + 100  # ₹5,000 profit
target_2 = entry + 200  # ₹10,000 profit

# Exit Strategy
at target_1 (₹5,000 profit):
    exit 50% position
    move stop to breakeven

at target_2 (₹10,000 profit):
    exit remaining 50%

# Fee Calculation
entry_fees = ~₹40
exit_fees = ~₹409 (for ₹3.7L position)
total_fees = ~₹450

net_profit_target_1 = 5000 - 450 = ₹4,550
net_profit_target_2 = 10000 - 450 = ₹9,550

# Adjust gross targets for fees
adjusted_target_1 = entry + 110 points  # To get ₹5k NET
adjusted_target_2 = entry + 210 points  # To get ₹10k NET
```

### Best Timeframes

**For Intraday**:
- **5-minute**: Entry and exit precision
- **15-minute**: Trend confirmation
- **1-hour**: Overall direction

**For Swing (2-5 days)**:
- **1-hour**: Entry timing
- **Daily**: Trend and levels

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Overtrading**: Taking too many trades
✅ **Solution**: Max 2-3 trades per day

❌ **No stop loss**: Hoping losing trade will reverse
✅ **Solution**: Always set stop loss before entry

❌ **Moving stop loss**: Moving stop further away when price approaches
✅ **Solution**: Never widen stop loss, only tighten

❌ **Averaging down**: Adding to losing position
✅ **Solution**: Only add to winning positions (pyramiding)

❌ **Revenge trading**: Trading emotionally after a loss
✅ **Solution**: Daily loss limit (3% max)

❌ **Ignoring fees**: Not calculating transaction costs
✅ **Solution**: Always calculate NET profit after fees

❌ **Trading against trend**: Trying to catch tops and bottoms
✅ **Solution**: Trade with the trend

❌ **Over-leveraging**: Using full margin
✅ **Solution**: Use max 50% of available margin
