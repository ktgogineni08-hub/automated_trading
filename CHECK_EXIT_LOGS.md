```bash
# Did monitoring happen?
grep "MONITORING:" logs/*.log

# Did it detect the profit?
grep "P&L=₹15,082" logs/*.log

# Should it exit?
grep "SHOULD EXIT.*NIFTY25O0725350PE" logs/*.log

# Did exit execute?
grep "EXIT EXECUTED.*NIFTY25O0725350PE" logs/*.log

# Did it fail?
grep "exit FAILED.*NIFTY25O0725350PE" logs/*.log

## Troubleshooting Based on Logs

### Scenario 1: No monitoring logs at all
**Logs show**: (nothing)
**Problem**: Monitoring loop not running or paused
**Solution**: Check if system is actually running

### Scenario 2: Monitoring happens but position not found
**Logs show**:
```
🔍 Position symbols: BANKEX25OCT62400CE, ...
```
(NIFTY not listed)
**Problem**: Position was already exited or not in portfolio
**Solution**: Check portfolio.positions

### Scenario 3: Position found but no price
**Logs show**:
```
⚠️ NIFTY25O0725350PE: No current price received!
```
**Problem**: Price fetching failed for this symbol
**Solution**: API issue or symbol mismatch

### Scenario 4: Price OK but "should NOT exit"
**Logs show**:
```
📈 NIFTY25O0725350PE: ... P&L=₹15,082
✋ NIFTY25O0725350PE should NOT exit (P&L: ₹15,082.56)
```
**Problem**: Exit logic not triggering (BUG!)
**Solution**: Check monitor_positions() logic

### Scenario 5: Should exit but execute fails
**Logs show**:
```
🚨 NIFTY25O0725350PE SHOULD EXIT: Quick profit taking (₹15,082 > ₹10k)
💼 Attempting exit for NIFTY25O0725350PE...
❌ execute_trade returned None - exit FAILED
```
**Problem**: execute_trade() returning None
**Solution**: Check execute_trade() logs for blocking condition

```
🚨 NIFTY25O0725350PE SHOULD EXIT: Quick profit taking (₹15,082 > ₹10k)
💼 Attempting exit...
✅ EXIT EXECUTED: ... | P&L: ₹15,082.56
